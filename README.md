# Settlers-of-Catan
Summer 2020 Solo Project

Settlers of Catan board game implementation designed for four players
Currently the game is not fully functional and some features still need to be
implemented. The current focus is to improve readability of the code and adjust
it to shorten the length of some functions.

TODO: Add functionality for webcams with four people, adjust flaws in style
and debug functionality in the code.
